# local-weather-app
App that displays users local weather view live @


This is a local weather app I created. I used Open Weather API. I had to rework this project to get it to work on github pages because open weather does not use SSL. I had to use crossoriginme and html5 geolocation instead of IP api for the same reason. The mixed content wasn't working. I left that code in for future use or rework.
